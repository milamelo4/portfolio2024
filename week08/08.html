        <h1>Week 08 Reading Notes</h1>
        <h2>JSON Web Tokens</h2>
        <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and
        self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a
        JSON object.</p>
        <p>Web Token structure:</p>
        <p>Three parts separated by dots (.):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header</li>
            <li>Payload</li>
            <li>Signature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong style="color: rgb(205, 139, 92);">header</strong> typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT,
        and the hashing algorithm such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. Im familiar with SHA256.</p>
        <pre>
        {
        'alg': 'HS256',
        'typ': 'JWT'
        }
        </pre>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.</p>
        <p>The <strong style="color: rgb(205, 139, 92);">payload</strong>, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity
        (typically, the user) and additional metadata. There are three types of claims:
        reserved, public, and private claims.</p>
        <p>Reserved: set of predefined claims, example: are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject)</p>
        <p>
            Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid
            collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be
            defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between
            parties that agree on using them.
        </p>
        <pre>
        {
        'sub': '1234567890',
        'name': 'John Doe',
        'admin': true
        }
        </pre>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JWT.</p>
        <p>The <strong style="color: rgb(205, 139, 92);">signature</strong> part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.</p>
        <pre>
        HMACSHA256(
        base64UrlEncode(header) + '.' +
        base64UrlEncode(payload),
        secret)
        </pre>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is
        and to ensure that the message was't changed in the way.</p>
        <p>Encoded Example:</p>
        <p style="color:aqua;">eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(213, 176, 249); margin-top: -20px;">eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.</p>

        <h3>How JSON Web Tokens work?</h3>
        <p>In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a
        JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must
        be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens
        longer than required.</p>
        <p>Whenever the user wants to access a protected route, it should send the JWT,
        typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema.</p>
        <pre>
        Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>JSON parsers are common in most programming languages, because they map directly
        to objects, conversely XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping.</p>
        <h3>How we use JSON Web Tokens in Auth0?</h3>
        <p>In Auth0, we issue JWTs as a result of the authentication process. When the user
        logs in using Auth0, a JWT is created, signed, and sent to the user. Auth0
        supports signing JWT with both HMAC and RSA algorithms. This token will be then
        used to authenticate and authorize with APIs which will grant access to their
        protected routes and resources.</p>
