        <h1>My Notes for week 01:</h1>
        
        <p>The readings for this week included syllabus, tips for working with group, and managing the Modern Frontend Workflow. </p>
        <p>
        No questions on the syllabus. I reviewed some of the basics of JS, I need a lot of more practice.
        As for working with groups, I have joined a team. I have microsoft teams and I have joined the class channel.
        Modern Fronted Workflow had nothing new, I’ve used CSS preprocessor SASS. I’m also familiar with package managers npm. However, I have never used Vite.
        </p>
        <p>
        I had no problem with the course set up, as I already had all the extensions necessary installed.
        I also completed the introduction to GitHub course without any issues.
        </p>

            <p>Enter a volume in quarts: <input type="number" id="volume"></p>
            <button type="submit" id="btn1">Calculate in liters</button>
            <p id="res1"></p>
            <li>Write a JavaScript program that asks a user for a distance in kilometers and then converts that value into miles. Your program should correctly handle real numbers.</li>
                <p>Enter the distance in k: <input type="number" id="distance"></p>
            <button type="submit" id="btn2">Calculate distance in miles</button>
            <p id="res2"></p>
            <li>Write a program that helps a user choose the correct foot wear for the day’s weather. The following table shows the weather types the user may enter and what your program should output.</li>
            <p>Enter (hot, rain, or snow): <input type="text" id="weather"></p>

        <h2>Arrays:</h2>
        <ol class="exercise">
             <li>Write JavaScript code to call the fill function as given in example 8 of this chapter and pass an array named altitudes to the fill function.</li>
            <button type="submit" id="btn4">Display Array</button>
            <p id="res4"></p>
            <li>Write a function that creates and returns an array that contains the values: 1908, 5, 10. The function must have this header: function mothersDay().</li>
            <button type="submit" id="btn5">Display Mother's Day</button>
            <p id="res5"></p>
            <li>Write a function that returns the sum of the first and last values in an array. The function must have this header:

            <p id="res6"></p>  
            <li>Write a function named getMiddle that returns the value of the middle element in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, then this function must return the average of the two middle elements. The function must have this header: function getMiddle(list)</li>  
             <button type="submit" id="btn7">Display middle</button>
            <p id="res7"></p> 
            <li>Write a function named countEvens that counts and returns the number of even integers in an array. The function must have this header: function countEvens(list):</li> 
            <button type="submit" id="btn8">Display Evens</button>
