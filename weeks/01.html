        <h1>My Notes for week 01:</h1>
        
            <p>The readings for this week included syllabus, tips for working with group, and managing the Modern Frontend Workflow. </p>
            <p>
            No questions on the syllabus. I reviewed some of the basics of JS, I need a lot of more practice.
            As for working with groups, I have slack and teams and I can use either or. Waiting to join a team.
            Modern Fronted Workflow had nothing new, I’ve used CSS preprocessor SASS. I’m also familiar with package managers npm. However, I have never used Vite.
            </p>
            <p>
            I had no problem with the course set up, as I already had all the extensions necessary installed.
            I also completed the introduction to GitHub course without any issues.
