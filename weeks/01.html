        <h1>My Notes for week 01:</h1>
        <p>The readings for this week included syllabus, tips for working with group, and managing the Modern Frontend Workflow. </p>
        <p>
        No questions on the syllabus. I reviewed some of the basics of JS, I need a lot of more practice.
        As for working with groups, I have slack and teams and I can use either or. Waiting to join a team.
        Modern Fronted Workflow had nothing new, I’ve used CSS preprocessor SASS. I’m also familiar with package managers npm. However, I have never used Vite.
        </p>
        <p>
        I had no problem with the course set up, as I already had all the extensions necessary installed.
        I also completed the introduction to GitHub course without any issues.
